At the IIT(BHU) Quiz Club, we believe quizzing is more than just a test of knowledge—it's about thinking critically and solving problems creatively. We explore a wide range of topics. Our goal is to nurture curiosity and challenge conventional thinking, not just among ourselves, but across the campus and beyond through open quizzes and competitions.

We consistently conduct quizzes not only within the club, but on social media platforms like Instagram and open quizzes for the entire college.
