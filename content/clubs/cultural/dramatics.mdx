eventText: "Masquerades performs various art forms:\n\n- **Mime:** A powerful silent act that speaks volumes through expressions and movements — where actions truly speak louder than words.\n- **Street Play (Nukkad Natak):** Bold, interactive, and socially-driven — performed in open spaces to ignite thought and spark dialogue on pressing issues.\n- **Stage Play:** A fusion of drama, direction, and storytelling performed under the spotlight — bringing characters and scripts to life on the proscenium.\n- **Monoact:** A solo performance showcasing versatility, where a single actor embodies multiple emotions, characters, or perspectives."
