eventText: "Health & Hygiene Club (HHC) actively engages in diverse initiatives aimed at improving community well-being and spreading awareness on health, hygiene, and sustainability. Volunteers regularly visit nearby bastis and schools to educate residents and students on issues like disease prevention, cleanliness, healthy habits, and first aid, while also introducing them to national welfare schemes. The club organizes impactful drives such as medicine collection, plantation, plogging, and blood donation camps, along with creative activities like drawing competitions, Republic Day celebrations, and Waste-to-Best projects, which combine learning with participation. By blending awareness sessions with hands-on efforts - ranging from distributing first aid kits to cleaning ghats - the club not only addresses pressing health and sanitation challenges but also fosters responsibility, empathy, and sustainable practices among students and communities."
