eventText: "Sahyog drives its mission through a set of impactful programs designed to empower students and communities. Gram Mela brings together parents, teachers, and students through interactive stalls on academics, careers, extracurriculars, digital awareness, science, and government schemes—strengthening the foundations of education and fostering collaboration. Our annual Sports Day, held on the birth anniversary of Major Dhyan Chand, promotes fitness, teamwork, and discipline while encouraging students to embrace a healthy lifestyle. Daan Utsav, celebrated during the Joy of Giving Week on Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary, spreads the spirit of generosity and compassion, inspiring students and communities alike. Meanwhile, DISHA, our summer mentorship program led by college volunteers, guides school students in academics and competitive exams while building confidence, curiosity, and lifelong learning. Together, these initiatives create lasting impact by combining education, mentorship, and values with community development."
