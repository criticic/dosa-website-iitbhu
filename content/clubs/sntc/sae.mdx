The SAE Collegiate Club at IIT (BHU) Varanasi is a student-driven technical society focused on hands-on learning in automotive and mobility engineering. The club actively works in domains such as vehicle dynamics, braking systems, aerodynamics, manufacturing, electronics, and control systems, giving members real engineering exposure beyond classrooms. Through participation in national-level competitions like Formula Bharat and Baja SAE and by building in-house vehicles and subsystems, the club emphasizes practical design, analysis, and manufacturing. It also conducts workshops, mentorship programs, and beginner-friendly competitions for freshers to build strong fundamentals in CAD, simulation, and core mechanical and mechatronics concepts. By combining teamwork, technical rigor, and innovation, the SAE club aims to develop industry-ready engineers with a strong understanding of real-world engineering challenges.

The SAE Collegiate Club is broadly divided into three major project-based teams, each working on a different engineering platform.

**The Trident Team** focuses on full-scale automotive engineering, where members design, analyze, and manufacture key vehicle subsystems such as the chassis, suspension, braking, powertrain, aerodynamics, and electronics for national-level competitions.

**The RC Car Team** works on small-scale racing vehicles, emphasizing rapid prototyping, lightweight design, basic aerodynamics, electronics, and control.

**The AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) Team** deals with underwater robotics, involving mechanical design, buoyancy control, sensors, embedded systems, control algorithms, and autonomy, bridging mechatronics, robotics, and marine engineering.
