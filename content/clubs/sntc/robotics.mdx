The Robotics Club is a dynamic community of students driven by curiosity and innovation in different domains of robotics. Open to all skill levels, the club provides a welcoming platform for beginners and experienced enthusiasts alike through hands-on projects, one-on-one mentorship, workshops, competitions and camps throughout the year. We actively explore diverse domains of robotics, with a strong focus on novel, untested ideas and learning-based approaches to robot planning, control, and decision-making in both single- and multi-agent systems. By fostering collaboration, experimentation, and continuous learning, the club aims to empower students to transform ideas into impactful solutions and contribute meaningfully to the global robotics community.
