The Club of Programmers (COPS) at IIT (BHU) has established itself as a premier technical club fostering excellence across multiple domains of computer science. Through its dedicated verticals—Infosec (IIT(BHU)CyberSec), Software Development Group (SDG), Intelligence Group (IG), and Competitive Programming Group (CPG)—COPS has created a vibrant culture of learning, innovation, and competitive excellence.

## Infosec (IIT(BHU)CyberSec)

The Infosec vertical is dedicated to enhancing cybersecurity awareness and practical skills. Throughout 2024-25, it delivered comprehensive "Learn to Hack" workshops covering Linux fundamentals, C programming, x86 assembly, and cybersecurity domains. The vertical launched Cicada_IITBHU, a unique treasure hunt for freshers, and organized Daily Infosec Challenges on an in-house CTF platform (ctfv.vercel.app) with 400+ registrations. WannaHack CTF attracted 110+ freshers, while Kashi CTF 2025 marked the institute's first international CTF with 1,200+ teams and 3,000+ participants. The team achieved global rank #250 on CTFtime (#10 in India), including a historic 1st place finish in SpookyCTF 2024, 2nd in Hackers N' Hops CTF, and top performances in CSAW CTF finals (28th & 33rd globally). Members have secured top positions in numerous national and international competitions, including Hack IITK Grand Finals.

## Software Development Group (SDG)

SDG fosters robust software development culture through diverse workshops on Linux, Git/GitHub, open-source contributions, and modern programming languages (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Solana, Avalanche). The flagship GSoC Mentorship Program has been instrumental in IIT (BHU)'s remarkable success, with 23 selections in GSoC 2024 and 20+ already confirmed for GSoC 2025, and another 15+ selections in LFX, Summer of Bitcoin, and Summer of Reproducibility, SciML Fellowship, and many more. SDG teams have won $20,000+ in blockchain hackathons (EthOnline, EthSingapore, Privacy4Web3, EthIndia, Euclid, Vara Megahack). Key projects include the IIT(BHU)CyberSec website, CTFv platform (free CTF hosting), and Permission Automation System for campus digitization. DebugIt Hackathon during COPS Week 2025 was scaled to national level with ₹1+ lakhs in prizes.

## Intelligence Group (IG)

IG empowers students in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science through structured workshops covering Python, Linear/Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Optimizers, RNNs/NLP, and Computer Vision. The Ctrl+Shift+Intelligence Hackathon during COPS Week 2025 challenged participants to build "AI for Smart and Adaptive Systems" with ₹40k+ in prizes. Members have secured prestigious research internships at IISc, CMI, various IITs, and international universities. Notable achievements include 1st place in Woodpecker Hackathon, "Best Use of Knowledge Graph RAG" in Hypermode Challenge, top positions in SARCathon, Technex Hackathon, NLP.py Hackathon, and multiple other national competitions.

## Competitive Programming Group (CPG)

CPG has been a driving force in fostering competitive programming culture through workshops on C++ basics, STL, Binary Search, Number Theory, Greedy Algorithms, and Bit Manipulation. The group achieved exceptional results in ICPC, with three teams qualifying for Asia West Finals—teams "Poocha Kya" and "Prefer Not To Say" ranked 7th and 11th respectively. Strong performances in regionals include 2nd in Kanpur, 4th in Amritapuri, and runner-up in Chennai. CPG organized NP Compete (36-hour marathon), freshers practice contests, and Lockout Battles during COPS Week 2025. Members have contributed as testers and problem setters for CodeChef contests and the GoForGold Camp.

## COPS @ Technex 2025 & Inter-IIT Tech Meet

COPS conceptualized and executed "Byte the Bits" events at Technex 2025 with ₹2.1 Lakhs prize pool and 1,200+ participants. Events included Game Jam, 1BRC Challenge, International Coding Marathon, Hack It Out, and CTF. At Inter-IIT Tech Meet 14.0, COPS teams achieved outstanding results: 1st place in Jilo Health, 3rd in ISRO VLM and Genuity IO, 4th in Observe.ai, 7th in Game Connect, and 9th in Pathway, Adobe, and Qtrino Labs. At Inter-IIT Tech Meet 13.0, teams secured commendable positions: 4th (ISRO), 5th (IGDC), 10th (Pathway), 11th (Adobe), 13th (FedEx), and 15th (Dream11) across diverse problem statements.

Through workshops, hackathons, competitions, mentorship programs, and impactful projects, COPS continues to empower students with cutting-edge skills, foster innovation, and achieve competitive excellence on national and international platforms.
