eventText: "The Design Club organizes regular Design Walks, workshops, and collaborative projects. We design identities for some of the largest events on campus like the institute's Kashiyatra, FMC Weekend, Spardha and Technex; our designs are seen across the campus ecosystem - for department activities and startups on campus. In short, all the designs related to institute activity are done by us.\n\nWe offer regular workshops, design walks focusing on ways to build robust design skills such as design principles, software tools, and creative processes to ensure round development/growth in this space. We deliver projects using design tools such as Figma for UI/UX and collaborative design, Adobe Illustrator for vector graphics and branding, and Photoshop for image manipulation and visual effect."

The Design Club of IIT(BHU) is a vibrant community of creative thinkers and visual storytellers, dedicated to transforming ideas into impactful design. A space for experimentation, imaginative play, and creative exploration; and where ideas grow into aesthetically meaningful, useful work. Our club thrives on curiosity, exploration and continuous learning.

We deliver projects using design tools such as Figma for UI/UX and collaborative design, Adobe Illustrator for vector graphics and branding, and Photoshop for image manipulation and visual effect. These platforms not only bring our creative visions to life but also prepare our members for real-world design environments.

## What We Do

**Skill-building Workshops and Peer Learning:** We offer regular workshops, design walks focusing on ways to build robust design skills such as design principles, software tools, and creative processes to ensure round development/growth in this space.

**Live Projects and Campus Impact:** We design identities for some of the largest events on campus like the institute's Kashiyatra, FMC Weekend, Spardha and Technex; our designs are seen across the campus ecosystem - for department activities and startups on campus.

## Our Vision

We aim to create not just designers, but visual problem solvers who can think critically, communicate ideas effectively, and collaborate with empathy. Whether it's UI/UX, branding, illustration, or motion design, we encourage our members to find their unique voice in the world of design.
