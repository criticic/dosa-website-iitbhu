eventText: "The Outreach Club transposes authenticity onto the screen by combining genuine feelings and real-life insights with the art of documentary filmmaking.\n\nThe club's most powerful and impactful documentary on the R.G.Kar Hospital incident of Kolkata that shook the whole country, was an attempt to bring out the brutal truths of the incident and show the pain of the nation that came out as one to stand for justice. The documentary highlights the opinions and efforts of the people, especially the medical students and doctors of Sundar Lal Hospital and IMS, BHU who came together to fight for the victim.\n\nOutreach club has been involved in the documentaries on the Model United Nations at IIT BHU, for the past few years, which demonstrate the power of documentary filmmaking to disseminate relevant and impactful stories to large and varied audiences. Each year MUN documentary brings our global and national issues that are being debated on, giving people the perspectives of each delegate on the ongoing issues. Outreach tries to throw some light on different committees and their functioning in the MUN – global committees like the UNSCW, UNHRC, UNEP, DISEC and national committees like the JPC and AIPPM.\n\nThere have been real voices through interviews with Professor H.C. Verma, and the Former Lieutenant Governor of Pondicherry Dr. Kiran Bedi, and their stories have provided inspiration to dream bigger dreams.\n\nOutreach's Freshers Introduction video, the Convocation Diaries and the Placement Diaries, represent some real defining moments of students' lives at IIT BHU, creating a form of documentation to ensure each moment remains special, real and part of the overall sense of IIT BHU Life. Through all these works, the Outreach Club shows that it is real stories that mean the most.\n\nOutreach's documentary series – \"Banaras Diaries\" – is a flagship project that delves deep into the soul of the city. It captures the essence of Banaras by bringing to light its rich culture, traditions, and timeless heritage that often get overshadowed in today's fast-paced, modern, and cluttered world. Through vivid storytelling and authentic visuals, the series strives to preserve the legacy of Banaras while offering fresh perspectives to the present generation."
