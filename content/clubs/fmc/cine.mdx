Cine Club is where stories come alive on screen. From ideation to editing to that goosebump moment when the film finally rolls, everything here is powered by the crazy energy of students who live and breathe movies.

Think of us as the campus version of a Bollywood set: a place where someone is scripting a thriller, someone else is scouting locations, another is perfecting a shot, and a few are just here for the popcorn and the post-screening gossip!

Cine Club celebrates cinema in all its forms: Bollywood classics, indie shorts, regional gems, international hits, and the quirky creations made by our own members. We host movie marathons, fun debates on whether SRK's best role was Swades or Chak De!, film appreciation sessions, and workshops where you can try your hand at direction, cinematography, editing, or acting.

But we don't just watch films - we make them happen. Got an idea for a short film? A skit that deserves the silver screen? Cine Club gives you the platform, the crew, and the vibe to bring it alive. Our student productions have lit up fests, open-air screenings, and online platforms, proving that you don't need a Yash Raj budget to create magic.

At its heart, Cine Club is about community - the thrill of a perfect one-take shot, chai-fuelled brainstorming nights, and the joy of sharing stories with people who get your filmy references.

So, whether you're a die-hard Bollywood buff, a binge-watcher, or just someone who loves a good story, come join us. Let's roll the camera, set the mood, and create blockbusters that IIT BHU will never forget.
