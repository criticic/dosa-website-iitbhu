The Cultural Council serves as the cornerstone of creative and cultural expression on campus, encompassing a wide spectrum of clubs dedicated to music, dance, drama, literature, and fine arts. Each club provides a distinct avenue for students to pursue their artistic passions—whether through the soulful renditions of the Indian Music Club (IMC), the energetic performances of the Dance Club (DFZ), the eloquent creations of the Literary Club, or the innovative artistry of Aavran. Collectively, these clubs foster an environment that values imagination, talent, and collaboration.

Beyond club activities, the Council actively organizes and supports cultural performances on significant occasions such as Independence Day, Janmashtami, and many others, ensuring that the rich cultural heritage of India is celebrated and cherished on campus. It also conducts its own flagship competitions, including Aagman, the intra-freshers cultural competition, and the General Championship (GC) Culturals, an inter-team championship that encourages excellence and healthy competition across diverse cultural domains.

Through its wide-ranging initiatives and events, the Cultural Council not only nurtures creativity but also provides students with invaluable opportunities for personal growth, leadership, and the creation of lifelong memories.
