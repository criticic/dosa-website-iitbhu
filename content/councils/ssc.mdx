The Social Service Council (SSC), IIT (BHU) is a student-led body under the Gymkhana, dedicated to fostering social responsibility, empathy, and action. We create opportunities for students to engage with issues like education, health, sustainability, and inclusivity through awareness drives, volunteering, and hands-on projects.

At SSC, we believe true learning goes beyond classrooms - our initiatives nurture not just skilled professionals, but compassionate citizens. Together, we strive to build a more empathetic and equitable world, one initiative at a time.
